Basic Workflow
==============

You are encouraged to help maintain and improve the ``beast``. Before doing so,
please familiarize yourself with basic version control and Git workflow
concepts. A good description of the standard fork-branch-pull workflow can be
found here:

- https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962

Some other useful guides are:

- https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_YKHXuJ-ak

In short, the fork-branch-pull workflow for contributing to the ``beast``
project is:

- Create your own 'fork' of the official ``beast`` repository

- Create purpose-specific 'branches' off your 'fork'

- Make changes or additions within the branches

- Contribute your modified codes to the ``beast`` project or share them with
  your collaborators via 'pull requests'

- Keep your fork updated to benefit from continued development of the
  official version and to minimize version conflicts

- Resolve version conflicts as much as possible before sending pull requests


``beast`` follows the same workflow and coding guidelines as
`Astropy`_. The following pages will help you get started with contributing
fixes, code, or documentation (no git or GitHub experience necessary):

* `How to make a code contribution <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_

* `Coding Guidelines <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide.html>`_

* `Developer Documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/#developer-documentation>`_


Installation
============

If you plan on modifying the ``beast`` in addition to running the code, it may
be useful to create a development installation by following the :ref:`Dev_install` instructions.


Adding Branches
===============

- Make sure you are in the directory for your fork of the beast. You will be on
  branch `master` by default.

- Create and switch to a branch (here named `beast-dev1`):

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git checkout -b beast-dev1

- To see a list of all branches of the fork, with '*' indicating which branch
  you are currently working on:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git branch

- To 'upload' this branch to your fork:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git push origin beast-dev1

- To revert back to your fork's `master` branch:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git checkout master


Making Changes
==============

It is recommended that branches have a single purpose; for example, if you are working
on adding a test suite, improving the fitting algorithm, and speeding up some task,
those should be in separate branches (e.g. `add-test-suite`, `improve-fitting-algorithm`
and `beast-dev1`).

- Switch to the branch you wish to work off of:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git checkout beast-dev1

- Make changes to the existing files as you wish and/or create new files.

- To see what changes have been made at any time:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git status

- To stage any new or edited file (e.g., 'newfile.py') in preparation for committing:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git add newfile.py

- To add all edited files (*not recommended* unless you are sure of all your changes):

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git add -A

- If you add a file type in the `beast/` folder that's not typically included
  (e.g., `.txt` or `.png`), you also need to list it in the ``[options.package_data]``
  section in `setup.cfg`.  Even if the file exists in the repository, adding it
  here is necessary for it to be included when the package is built.

- To 'commit' all changes after adding desired files:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git commit -m 'brief comments describing changes'

- Commit messages should be short but descriptive.

- To see the status of your changed files:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git status

- To view any differences between a file and the last committed version:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git diff PathToFile/filename

- To undo all changes made to a specific file since the last commit:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git checkout PathToFile/filename

- To sync changes made to the branch locally with your GitHub repository:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git push origin beast-dev1


Test Changes
============

It is a good idea to test that your changes have not caused problems.  In the
base ``beast`` directory the following commands may be run to do this.

Run existing tests, including a regression test against a full ``beast`` model
run.  Once the command below has finished, the coverage of the tests can
be viewed in a web browser by pointing to files in the `htmlconv` subdirectory
(which gets produced when the tests are run).

  .. code-block:: console

     $ tox -e test -- --remote-data --coverage

Make sure the documentation can be created.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ tox -e build_docs

The resulting HTML files are placed in the `docs/_build/html` subdirectory, and
can be viewed in a web browser.


Submitting a Pull Request
=========================

Once you have changes that you'd like to contribute back to the upstream branch,
you can open a pull request for review. Pull requests can be submitted at
https://github.com/BEAST-Fitting/beast/pulls. If you push any commits to your
origin repository in a development branch (`beast-dev1`), then a "Compare &
pull request" button should appear at the top of this site. Briefly describe the
changes/additions you made in the comments section and submit the pull request.


Staying up-to-date
==================

The ``beast`` project's official repository will be updated from time to time
to accommodate bug fixes, improvements and new features. You can keep your
fork's `master` repository up-to-date with the following steps:

- Switch to your fork's `master` branch:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git checkout master

- Fetch the project's up-to-date distribution:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git fetch upstream

- Merge the official (upstream) `master` branch with your fork's `master` branch:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git merge upstream/master

- Sync this change with your origin repository:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ git push origin master


BEAST on Slack
==============

There is a ``beast`` space on Slack.  Email kgordon@stsci.edu for an invite.


Visualizing Repository Commits
==============================

The commits to the ``beast`` repository can be visualized using `gource`.  This
creates a movie showing the time evolution of the code and who made the
changes.
