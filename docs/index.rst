BEAST
#####

The Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST) is a Python package that fits
the ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric SEDs of stars to extract stellar
and dust extinction parameters.
The stellar parameters are age (t), mass (M), metallicity (M), and distance (d).
The dust extinction parameters are dust column (Av), average grain size (Rv),
and mixing between type A and B extinction curves (fA).

The full details of the BEAST are provided by
Gordon et al. (2016, ApJ, 826, 104): http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...826..104G

Reporting Issues
================

If you have found a bug in ``beast`` please report it by creating a
new issue on the ``beast`` `GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/BEAST-Fitting/beast/issues>`_.

Please include an example that demonstrates the issue sufficiently so that
the developers can reproduce and fix the problem. You may also be asked to
provide information about your operating system and a full Python
stack trace.  The developers will walk you through obtaining a stack
trace if it is necessary.

Contributing
============

Like the `Astropy`_ project, the ``beast`` is made both by and for its
users.  We accept contributions at all levels, spanning the gamut from fixing a
typo in the documentation to developing a major new feature. We welcome
contributors who will abide by the `Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct
<https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/>`_.
